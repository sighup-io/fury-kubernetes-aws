This version contains provider upgrade to 2.46 and removal of "provider" from modules. Also added data.aws_ami owners when searching for AMI on AWS (now required).

## Provider Upgrade

### Issue

Update provider version as latest available version.

### Change

Updated tests to use provider 2.46

#### How to upgrade it

Change provider required version on infra terraform code to 2.46:

```hcl-terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"
  version = "2.46.0"
}
```

To be sure, remove .terraform directory and re-run `terraform init`


## Provider removal

Provider AWS declaration has been removed from modules. This is a best practice and also permits the usage of the modules when working with aws subaccounts.

## aws_ami owners

The Provider update caused the introduction of a new variable in the "data.aws_ami" resource used by the modules.
                  
The default variables have been set with the ids of the accounts that have the default AMI, in case the AMI used are not the default ones, it will be necessary to populate the corresponding inputs of the modules with the correct value.

Example for aws-kubernetes module:

```hcl-terraform
...
  kube-master-ami-owner = "363601582189"
  kube-master-ami       = "KFD-Ubuntu-Master-1.15.5-2-1575471112"
  kube-master-count     = 3
  kube-master-type      = "t3.large"
...
```
