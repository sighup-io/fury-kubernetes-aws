This version refactors how we manage route table rules on private and public route tables. The need is to remove the rules list from the aws_route_table terraform resource and to permit external route table edits (for example: adding a vpc peering connection).


## Route Table Refactoring

### Issue

Cannot customize route table rules with external terraform projects

### Change

Removed route object from aws_route_table public and private. Created the corresponding resources aws_route public and private.

#### How to upgrade provider

The upgrade path needs manual intervention on the AWS side.
The old egress route entries must be removed from the current route tables (public and private).

Then, you can apply the new configuration.

Downtime is expected if the services running inside the cluster need internet connectivity.
